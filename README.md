# Calibrating Phase Offsets for Commodity WiFi

## Introduction
This repo provide codes for the reference paper.  
Array Signal Processing(ASP) techniques are powerful tools for many applications such as indoor localization, wireless sensing. However, it requires accurate phase synchronization between antennas, which can be achieved by compensate phase offsets between RF chains on commodity WiFi chips. The phase offset was regarded as a random variable every time the WiFi chips restart. By conducting extensive experiments, we find out that the phase offsets are semi-time-invariant and the calibration can be simplified greatly. Please refer the reference for details.\
We provide codes and data in our experiments. Please run the main.c in the matlab folder to see the measurement results \
